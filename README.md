For the past 12 months, I have been executing a solo build of **JARVIS** — a three-repository, multi-process autonomous AI operating system spanning Python, C++, Rust, Swift, Objective-C, and TypeScript. The system orchestrates 60+ asynchronous agents across a neural mesh, routes inference dynamically between local Apple Silicon and GCP, performs real-time voice biometric authentication, controls macOS at the native API level, and continuously trains its own models through a self-improving feedback loop.

## Background

I graduated from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo with a B.S. in Computer Engineering after a [10-year non-traditional academic path](https://mustangnews.net/10-years-in-the-making-one-cal-poly-students-unique-path-to-an-engineering-degree/) that started in remedial algebra at community college. I retook courses, studied through the loss of family, and spent most of my twenties earning a degree that others finish in four years. The path was not conventional. The outcome was.

JARVIS is what happens when that level of persistence meets engineering capability. Twelve months of daily commits, architectural decisions at every layer of the stack, and a refusal to ship anything that is not production-grade.
